          In a bustling city, Bipin, an ambitious entrepreneur, envisioned a platform called &quot;Kabadi Jee&quot; to address the issue of discarded items littering the streets. With a passion for
          technology and a desire to make a positive impact, Bipin and his team created a website that served as a virtual hub for scrap collection. Kabadi Jee aimed to connect people from all walks
          of life, encouraging them to repurpose and collect scrap materials.
